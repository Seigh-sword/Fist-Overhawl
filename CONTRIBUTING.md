## 2. THE GOLDEN RULE
By contributing, you agree that your code will be covered under the **FIST OVERHAUL FREEDOM LICENSE**. Your work will remain free forever and can never be sold.

## 3. ASSET GUIDELINES
If you are contributing PNG parts (hair, clothes, effects):
- They must be transparent PNGs.
- They must align with the base character dimensions.
- No copyrighted material.

## 4. HOW TO SUBMIT
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch for your "re-model."
3. We recommned using a github Codespace becuase if you dont want, to waste your system resources this is great!
4. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of changes.

## 5. CODE STYLE
- No bloated libraries.
- Keep memory usage low (respect the "potato" laptop users... me).
- Commenting is optional, but logic must be clean.
